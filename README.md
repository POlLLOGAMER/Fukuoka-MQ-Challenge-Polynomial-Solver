# Achievements

First of all, you can find my solver in the `.ipynb` file, which is designed to solve any **Fukuoka MQ Challenge**. Feel free to test it out!

I have already executed the solver against the **Fukuoka MQ Challenge Type VI (Seed 33)**. You can find the `.bz2` file in this repository, or download it directly from the official link here:

My solver, powered by an **ultra-advanced heuristic**, solved it in just **179.0972 seconds!** Yes, a **Type VI** challenge solved on a standard **Colab CPU**!
